# Useful vs code extensions

Ones of the most useful extensions to work with jest are:
- `jest` - it shows tests state and adds intellisence (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest),
- `jest-runner` - it allows running tests using menu opened by right clicking (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner).

# Snippets

It's worth to use snippets for tests boilerplate. Some folders in this repo contains a file called snippet.json. You can find a snippets for specific test case there. To use them go to `File->Preferences->User Snippets`, choose `javascript.json` and copy them to there.

To create your own snippet I recommend https://snippet-generator.app/.
